# Categorization Component

> This component uses sorting criteria to create and render lists of videos.The three basic sorting criteria are: Recent broadcasts, Recent highlights & uploads, and Popular clips. More sorting criteria may be added as the project progresses. The lists that the component renders are 1-1 with the sorting criteria, i.e., there will be one list for each sorting criterion.

(if your MySQL requires a password use: `mysql -u root -p < database/schema.sql`)

Now run the seed script:

```sh
npm run seed
```

For game data (good for presentations):
